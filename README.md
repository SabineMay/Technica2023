NDTK Error Discussion: 
- Proper nouns ("American" vs John)
- Compound nouns ("diving board")
    - generalizations don't work: I like reading books != I like (reading books)
    - solution: look-a-head by one in the tuples list, combining bigrams that would form a new word in a dictionary of compound words 
- apostrophe's: she can't do it 
- Verbs with particles ("sit down")
